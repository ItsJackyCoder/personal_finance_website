The development of this website is based on Python and Flask, two powerful tools that allow me to efficiently handle backend logic. For the frontend, I used JavaScript and HTML to enable dynamic interactions and page rendering. The website’s data is stored in a MySQL database, which is deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)’s Cloud SQL service, ensuring the stability and scalability of the data. To provide the best user experience, I chose Bootstrap to quickly build a responsive webpage, ensuring that the website displays smoothly on various devices. In addition, the website integrates a real-time stock price API, providing users with the ability to record stock prices. Finally, the website is deployed on the Render cloud platform, enabling convenient cloud-based operation and management.

The purpose of this website is to manage and track the changes in cash and stock storage.
